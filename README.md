# Adit's Web

Just another terminal website...

Notable features
- No data is stored server-side, everything is in an in-browser SQL DB using [`sql.js`](https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js?tab=readme-ov-file)
- Users can ask an AI agent about me, the agent uses a mix of tools to answer the question (SQL, RAG, ...more to come)
- Most of the interesting quirks of this website are actually in the [backend repo](https://github.com/adit-bala/knowledge-base)
